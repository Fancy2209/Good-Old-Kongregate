Make Kongregate look like the Good Old Days!

## 
This repository is for developing Good Old Kongregate, a user script aiming to revert the atrocious Kongregate "redesign" from 2023 and beyond, with what existed prior to those dark times.
There is still a lot of work left to do, as some pages like the achievements, games (the list of games on the site, not games themselves) and search pages are completely broken with the script. They need further attention.
Any help would be much welcome, and greatly appreciated.

To install the user script, please go to [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts?q=Kongregate)
