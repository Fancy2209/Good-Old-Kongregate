**Before installing this script, make sure that you have installed (and enabled) a user script manager (a browser extension such as Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey, Greasymonkey or another monkey).**

Good Old Kongregate makes Kongregate look as it did before 2023, as if the atrocious "redesign" never occured.

The script is not finished because we lack the time, so feel free to help us on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fancy2209/Good-Old-Kongregate). In the meanwhile, a lot of pages are already being displayed almost perfectly, including the most important ones: the game pages! A few sets of pages are completely broken, however, so the script is disabled by default on them.
